#  Presentation Service

The library supports document presentation via BLE or online verifier

The ``PresentationService`` protocol abstracts the presentation flow. The ``BlePresentationService`` and ``OpenId4VpService`` classes implement the proximity and remote presentation flows respectively. The ``PresentationSession`` class is used to wrap the presentation service and provide `@Published` properties for SwiftUI screens. The following example code demonstrates the initialization of a SwiftUI view with a new presentation session of a selected ``FlowType``.

```swift
let session = eudiWallet.beginPresentation(flow: flow)
// pass the session to a SwiftUI view
ShareView(presentationSession: session)
```

On view appearance the attestations are presented with the ``PresentationService/receiveRequest()``  method. For the BLE (proximity) case, the ``PresentationSession/deviceEngagement`` property is populated with the QR code to be displayed on the holder device.

```swift
.task {
	 if presentationSession.flow.isProximity { await presentationSession.startQrEngagement() }
	 _ = await presentationSession.receiveRequest()
}
```
After the request is received the ``PresentationSession/disclosedDocuments`` contains the requested attested items. The selected state of the items can be modified via UI binding. Finally, the response is sent with the following code: 

```swift
// Send the disclosed document items after biometric authentication (FaceID or TouchID)
// if the user cancels biometric authentication, onCancel method is called
 await presentationSession.sendResponse(userAccepted: true,
	itemsToSend: presentationSession.disclosedDocuments.items, onCancel: { dismiss() }, onSuccess: {
			if let url = $0 { 
				// handle URL
			 }
		})
```
